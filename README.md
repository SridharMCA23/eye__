# eye__

Discription:
This HTML and CSS code create a simple webpage with two "eyes" that follow the mouse cursor. The eyes are styled to appear as white circles with black pupils that move in response to the mouse's position. The JavaScript code tracks the mouse movement and updates the position of the pupils accordingly.

Here's a brief 7-line description:

HTML Structure: Defines a webpage with two eyes using HTML5 elements and sets the document's title.

CSS Styling: Styles the eyes and pupils with specific dimensions, colors, and positioning, including a dark gray background.

JavaScript Interaction: Utilizes JavaScript to track mouse movement and update the position of the pupils, giving the illusion of the eyes following the cursor.

In summary, the code creates an interactive and playful effect where the eyes visually track the movement of the mouse cursor.
